Same sample as this published study: 10.1038/ncomms6394.  \n\nStudy 1: 80 healthy participants + 5 placebo session from a pilot of the drug study.  Total n=85.   But Subj 173 might have bad EEG.   \n\nStudy 2: 30 healthy participants (3 dropout) in a double-blind drug study.    Total n=27.   Drug was Cabergoline 1.25 mg.   \n\nIf you look in the code folder at the .xls sheet, you'll see that subjects had different initial IDs.  \n\nStudy 1 subjects had subject IDs 101-180 plus the 5 placebo runs from an early test of ultra-low-dose cabergoline: these pilot runs were subject # 301/401 | 305/405.   Study 2 subjects had IDs 306/406 | 335/435.   Why the odd ranges for the drug study?   Glad you asked.  The dual numbers were for session:  300s were first session, 400s were second session.  The last two digits were subject ID.  (here with the benefit of BIDS formatting we have simply put them in as session 1 and session 2 with unique sub-#, which is BETTER).  \n\nFor example.  Joe Smith would have been 305 on visit 1, then 405 on visit 2.   Jane Henderson would have been 306 on visit 1, then 406 on visit 2.   Whatever visit got cab or placebo is indicated in the .xls sheet as well as on the Sess1_Drug and Sess2_Drug columns in the main .tsv file.   \n\nTask included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2012-2013 in Laboratory for Neural Computation & Cognition at Brown.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   A few old analysis scripts are included.  - James F Cavanagh 02/15/2021\n\nUPDATES:   \n1) Uploaded a .json sidecar developed by EEGLab for NEMAR indexing:  task-PST_events.json\n2) Since this was updated, I had to erase each subject's *_events.json files.   \n3) Note that the Reward and Penalty feedback labels ('FB: 0' and 'FB: +1') are incorrect here.   The actual feedback was 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect.'   I'm just going to leave those as-is in the files since it doesn't change too much.  Run the task (under /stimuli) to see what the feedbacks look like.\n4) there was a bug in the original task description that indicated this as 'Simon Conflict'.  This is not that task.  This is a Probabilistic Selection Task.  These should have been changed to PST, but if you see SimonConflict just realize that was an original mis-label.",

      "readme": "**PARADIGM:** The study uses the method of guided imagery to induce resting, eyes-closed participants using voice-guided imagination to enter distinct 15 emotion states during acquisition of high-density EEG data. \n\nDuring the study, participants listen to 15 voice recordings that each suggest imagining a scenario in which they have experienced -- or would experience the named target emotion. Some target emotions have positive valence (e.g., joy, happiness), others negative valence (e.g., sadness, anger). Before and between the 15 emotion imagination periods, participants hear relaxation suggestions ('Now return to a neutral state by ...').\n\n**PROCEDURE:** When the participant first begins to feel the target emotion, they are asked to indicate this by pressing a handheld button. Participants are asked to continue feeling the emotion as long as possible.  To intensify and lengthen the periods of experienced emotion, participants are asked to interoceptively perceive and attend relevant somatosensory sensations. When the target feeling wanes (typically after 1 and 5 minutes), participants push the button again to leave the emotion imagination period and cue the relaxation instructions.\n\n**DATA HANDLING:** The raw data have been preprocessed to fix confusing event codes and to remove excessively noisy channels. In addition, a 1-Hz high pass filter  was applied to ready the data for ICA decomposition. Note: Unfortunately, the unfiltered data are no longer available.\n\n**NOTE:** Sub22 was a repeat subject, hence was removed from the dataset.",

      "readme": "This study is described at https://osf.io/qt2zh/. Scripts used for data processing are posted there.\n\nHere is the script from the manuscript that describes these data.\n\nError-related negativity is a widely used measure of error monitoring, and many projects are independently moving ERN recorded during a flanker task towards standardization, optimization, and eventual clinical application. However, each project uses a different version of the flanker task and tacitly assumes ERN is functionally equivalent across each version. The routine neglect of a rigorous test of this assumption undermines efforts to integrate ERN findings across tasks, optimize and standardize ERN assessment, and widely apply ERN in clinical trials. The purpose of this registered report was to determine whether ERN shows similar experimental effects (correct vs. error trials) and data quality (intraindividual variability) during three commonly-used versions of a flanker task. ERN was recorded from 172 participants during three versions of a flanker task across two study sites. ERN scores showed numerical differences between tasks, raising questions about the comparability of ERN findings across studies and tasks. Although ERN scores from all three versions of the flanker task yielded high data quality and internal consistency, one version did outperform the other two in terms of the size of experimental effects and the data quality. Exploratory analyses of the error positivity (Pe) provided tentative support for the other two versions of the task over the paradigm that appeared optimal for ERN. The present study provides a roadmap for how to statistically compare psychometric characteristics of ERP scores across paradigms and gives preliminary recommendations for flanker tasks to use for ERN- and Pe-focused studies.",

Stimuli consisted of 100 moving dots within a circle (3 radius) at the center of the screen. On each trial, participants indicated whether the motion direction of the dots was to the left or to the right by reaching and clicking on one of two choice targets (3 radius circle) at the top corners of the screen with a mouse. After 6 seconds without response, a buzz sound rang and a message was displayed inviting the participant to respond quicker. Motion coherence was adapted at the individual level via a 1up/2down staircase procedure in order to match task-performance between groups. Following each perceptual decision, participants were asked to report their confidence about their response using a vertical visual analog scale from 0% (Sure incorrect) to 100% (Sure correct), with 50% confidence meaning Not sure at all.\u0000",

      "readme": "This dataset contains the EEG used in the paper: Evidence accumulation relates to perceptual consciousness and monitoring, 2021, Nature Communications\n\nParticipants:\nTwenty healthy participants (7 woman; age: 25.2, SD = 4.1) participated in this study for a 40 CHF compensation. Subjects gave written informed consent prior to participating and all experimental procedures were approved by the Commission Cantonale d'Ethique de la Recherche de la République et Canton de Genève (2015-00092 15-273). \n\nOne patient with intractable epilepsy. The patient provided informed written consent for the present  study which was approved by the Commission Cantonale d’Ethique de la Recherche de la République et Canton de Genève (2016-01856). \n\nStimuli were applied on the lateral palmar side of the right wrist using a MMC3 Haptuator vibrotactile device from TactileLabs Inc. (Montreal, Canada) driven by a 230 Hz sinusoid audio signal lasting 100 ms. Experiments started by a simple estimation of the individual detection threshold. The tactile stimulus was applied with decreasing intensity with steps corresponding to 2% of the initial intensity until the participant reported not feeling it anymore three times in a row. We then repeated the same procedure but with increasing intensity and until the participant reported feeling the vibration three times in a row. The perceptual threshold was estimated to be the average between the two thresholds found using this procedure. This approximation was then used as a seed value for an adaptive staircase during the main experiment.\n \nParticipants sat in front of a computer screen. A white fixation cross appeared in the middle of the screen for 2 s. From the moment the fixation cross turned green, participants were told that a tactile stimulus could be applied at any moment during the next 2 s. During this period, stimulus onset was uniformly distributed in 80% of trials, the 20% remaining trials served as catch trials. In all trials, 1 second after the green cross disappeared, participants were prompted to answer with the keyboard whether they felt the stimulus or not. Following a 500 ms stimulus onset asynchrony, participants were asked to report the confidence in their first order response by moving a slider on a visual analog scale with marks at 0 (certainty that the first-order response was erroneous), 0.5 (unsure about the first-order response) and 1.0 (certainty that the first-order response was correct). Detection and confidence reports were provided with the left (non-stimulated) hand, using different keys. The total experiment included 500 trials divided in 10 blocks and lasted about 2 hours. \n\n\nRecordings:\nElectroencephalographic data were acquired from 62 active electrodes (10-20 montage) using a WaveGuard EEG cap and amplifier (ANTNeuro, Hengelo, The Netherlands) and digitized at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. Horizontal and vertical electrooculography (EOG) was derived using bipolar referenced electrodes placed around participants' eyes. The audio signal driving the vibrotactile actuator was recorded as an extra channel to precisely realign data to stimulus onset.\n\nFor the patient, electrocorticographical data was obtained through a 24 electrode ECoG grid (Ad-Tech Medical) covering the left hemisphere from the premotor cortex to the superior parietal lobule. The electrodes had a 4 mm diameter with 2.3 mm exposed corresponding to an area of 4.15 mm2. The data was amplified and sampled at 2048 Hz (Brain Quick LTM, Micromed, Treviso, Italy).",

They underwent two sessions:\nsession 1: EEG measures with a 5 min resting-state alternating between eyes closed and eyes open (30 sec each). EEG apparatus: 64 electrodes Biosemi Active-two amplifier (data acquired at 512 Hz)\nsession 2: behavioral measures, with the nine cognitive tasks in the following order: antisaccade, letter-memory, color–shape, number–letter, Stroop, keep track, dual n-back, category switch, stop-signal. \n\n### Experimental location and acquisition timeframe\nThe experiment took place in the Centre de Neuroergonomie at ISAE-SUPAERO (Toulouse, France), from february 2022 to july 2023.\n\n## Installation and Setup\nThe repository contains scripts for preprocessing and analyzing behavioral and EEG data, as well as the project's documentation and results.\nSee code_documentation.pdf in \\docs (available in https://osf.io/fm58p/).\n\n## Publications\nRegistered Report stage 1 IPA: EEG resting-state microstates correlates of executive functions (https://osf.io/dwz2r)\nRegistered Report stage 2: Investigating the relationship between Resting-State EEG Microstates and Executive Functions: A Null Finding (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2024.05.019)\n\n## Authors\nQuentin Chenot, Caroline Hamery, Moritz Truninger, Xavier De Boissezon, Nicolas Langer, Sébastien Scannella\n\n## CRediT author statement\nQC: conceptualization, methodology, software, formal analysis, investigation, data curation, writing – original draft, writing – review & editing, Visualization.\nCH: methodology, software, validation, formal analysis, data curation, writing – review & editing, visualization.\nMT: methodology, software, validation, formal analysis, data curation, writing – review & editing, visualization.\nNL: methodology, software, validation, formal analysis, resources, writing – review & editing.\nXDB: resources, writing – review & editing, supervision, funding acquisition.\nSS: conceptualization, methodology, resources, writing – review & editing, supervision, project administra...",
