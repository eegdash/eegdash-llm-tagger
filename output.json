      "readme": "# The HBN-EEG Dataset\nThis is **Release 1** of HBN-EEG, the EEG and (soon-released) Eye-Tracking Section of the Child Mind Network Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Project, curated into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This dataset is part of a larger initiative to advance the understanding of child and adolescent mental health through collecting and analyzing neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic data (Alexander et al., Sci Data 2017).\n\n## Data Description\nThis dataset comprises electroencephalogram (EEG) data and behavioral responses collected during EEG experiments from >3000 participants (5-21 yo) involved in the HBN project. The data has been released in 11 separate Releases, each containing data from a different set of participants.\n\n### Tasks\nThe HBN-EEG dataset includes EEG recordings from participants performing six distinct tasks, which are categorized into passive and active tasks based on the presence of user input and interaction in the experiment.\n\n#### Passive Tasks\n1. **Resting State**: Participants rested with their heads on a chin rest, following instructions to open or close their eyes and fixate on a central cross.\n\n2. **Surround Suppression**: Participants viewed flashing peripheral disks with contrasting backgrounds, while event markers and conditions were recorded.\n\n3. **Movie Watching**: Participants watched four short movies with different themes, with event markers recording the start and stop times of presentations.\n\n#### Active Tasks\n4. **Contrast Change Detection**: Participants identified flickering disks with dominant contrast changes and received feedback based on their responses.\n\n5. **Sequence Learning**: Participants memorized and repeated sequences of flashed circles on the screen, designed for different age groups.\n\n6. **Symbol Search**: Participants performed a computerized symbol search task, identifying target symbols from rows of search symbols.\n\n### Contents\n* **EEG Data:** High-resolution EEG recordings capture a wide range of neural activity during various tasks.\n* **Behavioral Responses:** Participant responses during EEG tasks, including reaction times and accuracy. This data was originally recorded within the behavior directory of the HBN data. The data is now included with the EEG data within the `events.tsv` files.\n\n### Special Features\n* **Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED):** Events, including the original EEG events and the included behavioral events, have clear explanations, including proper HED annotation suitable for systematic meta and mega analysis of the data.\n* **P-Factor, Attention, Internalization and Externalization:** Derived from the CBCL questionnaire, these factors provide valuable insights into the psychopathology of the participants, adding a rich layer of interpretation to the EEG and behavioral data.\n* **Data quality and availability:** We performed minimal quality control to ensure that the data was not corrupted, each task had its necessary events, and was ready for preprocessing. The results of this quality control are available in the `participants.tsv` file.\n* **Future Releases:** We are committed to enhancing this dataset with additional, valuable features in its next stages, including:\n  * **Personalized EEG Electrode Locations:** To offer more detailed insights into individual neural activity patterns.\n  * **Personalized Lead Field Matrix:** Enabling better understanding and interpretation of EEG data.\n  * **Eye-Tracking Data:** Providing a window into the visual attention and processing mechanisms during EEG experiments.\n\n## Other HBN-EEG Datasets\nFor access all releases of the HBN-EEG dataset, follow this [link on NEMAR.org](https://nemar.org/dataexplorer/local?search=HBN-EEG).

Press to begin. First, we have to measure the position of your eyes. Just follow the circle with your eyes.\n\nTask 'RestingState':\nTaskName: RestingState\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed a standard fixation cross in the center of the computer screen. The recorded voice of a female research assistant instructed them to 'now open your eyes' (rest with eyes open for 20 s) and 'now close your eyes' (rest with eyes closed for 40 s); this procedure was repeated 5 times, alternating between eyes opened and eyes closed. For purposes of analysis, we were mainly interested in the eyes-closed condition, due to the lower frequency of eye blinks. However, we interspersed the brief eyes-open blocks throughout the task in order to ensure that participants remained engaged for the duration of the task session.\nInstructions: Fixate on the central cross. Open or close your eyes when you hear the request for it. Press to begin.\n\nTask 'ThePresent':\nTaskName: ThePresent\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed 4 short, age-appropriate video clips taken from television and movies.

The data has been released in 11 separate Releases, each containing data from a different set of participants.\n\n### Tasks\nThe HBN-EEG dataset includes EEG recordings from participants performing six distinct tasks, which are categorized into passive and active tasks based on the presence of user input and interaction in the experiment.\n\n#### Passive Tasks\n1. **Resting State**: Participants rested with their heads on a chin rest, following instructions to open or close their eyes and fixate on a central cross.\n\n2. **Surround Suppression**: Participants viewed flashing peripheral disks with contrasting backgrounds, while event markers and conditions were recorded.\n\n3. **Movie Watching**: Participants watched four short movies with different themes, with event markers recording the start and stop times of presentations.\n\n#### Active Tasks\n4. **Contrast Change Detection**: Participants identified flickering disks with dominant contrast changes and received feedback based on their responses.\n\n5. **Sequence Learning**: Participants memorized and repeated sequences of flashed circles on the screen, designed for different age groups.\n\n6. **Symbol Search**: Participants performed a computerized symbol search task, identifying target symbols from rows of search symbols.\n\n### Contents\n* **EEG Data:** High-resolution EEG recordings capture a wide range of neural activity during various tasks.\n* **Behavioral Responses:** Participant responses during EEG tasks, including reaction times and accuracy. This data was originally recorded within the behavior directory of the HBN data. The data is now included with the EEG data within the `events.tsv` files.\n\n### Special Features\n* **Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED):** Events, including the original EEG events and the included behavioral events, have clear explanations, including proper HED annotation suitable for systematic meta and mega analysis of the data.\n* **P-Factor, Attention, Internalization and Externalization:** Derived from the CBCL questionnaire, these factors provide valuable insights into the psychopathology of the participants, adding a rich layer of interpretation to the EEG and behavioral data.\n* **Data quality and availability:** We performed minimal quality control to ensure that the data was not corrupted, each task had its necessary events, and was ready for preprocessing. The results of this quality control are available in the `participants.tsv` file.\n* **Future Releases:** We are committed to enhancing this dataset with additional, valuable features in its next stages, including:\n  * **Personalized EEG Electrode Locations:** To offer more detailed insights into individual neural activity patterns.\n  * **Personalized Lead Field Matrix:** Enabling better understanding and interpretation of EEG data.\n  * **Eye-Tracking Data:** Providing a window into the visual attention and processing mechanisms during EEG experiments.\n\n## Other HBN-EEG Datasets\nFor access all releases of the HBN-EEG dataset, follow this [link on NEMAR.org](https://nemar.org/dataexplorer/local?search=HBN-EEG).

Press to begin. First, we have to measure the position of your eyes. Just follow the circle with your eyes.\n\nTask 'RestingState':\nTaskName: RestingState\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed a standard fixation cross in the center of the computer screen. The recorded voice of a female research assistant instructed them to 'now open your eyes' (rest with eyes open for 20 s) and 'now close your eyes' (rest with eyes closed for 40 s); this procedure was repeated 5 times, alternating between eyes opened and eyes closed. For purposes of analysis, we were mainly interested in the eyes-closed condition, due to the lower frequency of eye blinks. However, we interspersed the brief eyes-open blocks throughout the task in order to ensure that participants remained engaged for the duration of the task session.\nInstructions: Fixate on the central cross. Open or close your eyes when you hear the request for it. Press to begin.\n\nTask 'ThePresent':\nTaskName: ThePresent\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed 4 short, age-appropriate video clips taken from television and movies.

Esper, Dung Truong (and 3 more)\nAcknowledgment: Please cite the dataset paper (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.03.615261) as well as the original HBN publication (https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.181).\nReferences: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.03.615261; https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.181; https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.40\nDOI: doi:10.18112/openneuro.ds005512.v1.0.1",
      "readme": "# The HBN-EEG Dataset\nThis is **Release 8** of HBN-EEG, the EEG and (soon-released) Eye-Tracking Section of the Child Mind Network Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Project, curated into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This dataset is part of a larger initiative to advance the understanding of child and adolescent mental health through collecting and analyzing neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic data (Alexander et al., Sci Data 2017).\n\n## Data Description\nThis dataset comprises electroencephalogram (EEG) data and behavioral responses collected during EEG experiments from >3000 participants (5-21 yo) involved in the HBN project. The data has been released in 11 separate Releases, each containing data from a different set of participants.\n\n### Tasks\nThe HBN-EEG dataset includes EEG recordings from participants performing six distinct tasks, which are categorized into passive and active tasks based on the presence of user input and interaction in the experiment.\n\n#### Passive Tasks\n1. **Resting State**: Participants rested with their heads on a chin rest, following instructions to open or close their eyes and fixate on a central cross.\n\n2. **Surround Suppression**: Participants viewed flashing peripheral disks with contrasting backgrounds, while event markers and conditions were recorded.\n\n3. **Movie Watching**: Participants watched four short movies with different themes, with event markers recording the start and stop times of presentations.\n\n#### Active Tasks\n4. **Contrast Change Detection**: Participants identified flickering disks with dominant contrast changes and received feedback based on their responses.\n\n5. **Sequence Learning**: Participants memorized and repeated sequences of flashed circles on the screen, designed for different age groups.\n\n6. **Symbol Search**: Participants performed a computerized symbol search task, identifying target symbols from rows of search symbols.\n\n### Contents\n* **EEG Data:** High-resolution EEG recordings capture a wide range of neural activity during various tasks.\n* **Behavioral Responses:** Participant responses during EEG tasks, including reaction times and accuracy. This data was originally recorded within the behavior directory of the HBN data. The data is now included with the EEG data within the `events.tsv` files.\n\n### Special Features\n* **Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED):** Events, including the original EEG events and the included behavioral events, have clear explanations, including proper HED annotation suitable for systematic meta and mega analysis of the data.\n* **P-Factor, Attention, Internalization and Externalization:** Derived from the CBCL questionnaire, these factors provide valuable insights into the psychopathology of the participants, adding a rich layer of interpretation to the EEG and behavioral data.\n* **Data quality and availability:** We performed minimal quality control to ensure that the data was not corrupted, each task had its necessary events, and was ready for preprocessing. The results of this quality control are available in the `participants.tsv` file.\n* **Future Releases:** We are committed to enhancing this dataset with additional, valuable features in its next stages, including:\n  * **Personalized EEG Electrode Locations:** To offer more detailed insights into individual neural activity patterns.\n  * **Personalized Lead Field Matrix:** Enabling better understanding and interpretation of EEG data.\n  * **Eye-Tracking Data:** Providing a window into the visual attention and processing mechanisms during EEG experiments.\n\n## Other HBN-EEG Datasets\nFor access all releases of the HBN-EEG dataset, follow this [link on NEMAR.org](https://nemar.org/dataexplorer/local?search=HBN-EEG).

(Prior to this task, parents were given the opportunity to review the full list of clips and exclude any video clips they deemed unsuitable for their children; no parents had any objections to the clips.). VideoDescription: Rating: No parental guideline rating, Description: This video depicts fractal-based geometry in everyday objects and visually depicts how some fractals are created., Rationale: This clip is included to probe for attention related dif ficulties., Link: https://youtu.be/XwWyTts06tU, Length: 2:43\nInstructions: Just maintain fixation on the central spot at all times. Press to begin. First, we have to measure the position of your eyes. Just follow the circle with your eyes.\n\nTask 'RestingState':\nTaskName: RestingState\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed a standard fixation cross in the center of the computer screen. The recorded voice of a female research assistant instructed them to 'now open your eyes' (rest with eyes open for 20 s) and 'now close your eyes' (rest with eyes closed for 40 s); this procedure was repeated 5 times, alternating between eyes opened and eyes closed. For purposes of analysis, we were mainly interested in the eyes-closed condition, due to the lower frequency of eye blinks. However, we interspersed the brief eyes-open blocks throughout the task in order to ensure that participants remained engaged for the duration of the task session.\nInstructions: Fixate on the central cross. Open or close your eyes when you hear the request for it.

      "readme": "# The HBN-EEG Dataset\nThis is **Release 6** of HBN-EEG, the EEG and (soon-released) Eye-Tracking Section of the Child Mind Network Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Project, curated into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This dataset is part of a larger initiative to advance the understanding of child and adolescent mental health through collecting and analyzing neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic data (Alexander et al., Sci Data 2017).\n\n## Data Description\nThis dataset comprises electroencephalogram (EEG) data and behavioral responses collected during EEG experiments from >3000 participants (5-21 yo) involved in the HBN project. The data has been released in 11 separate Releases, each containing data from a different set of participants.\n\n### Tasks\nThe HBN-EEG dataset includes EEG recordings from participants performing six distinct tasks, which are categorized into passive and active tasks based on the presence of user input and interaction in the experiment.\n\n#### Passive Tasks\n1. **Resting State**: Participants rested with their heads on a chin rest, following instructions to open or close their eyes and fixate on a central cross.\n\n2. **Surround Suppression**: Participants viewed flashing peripheral disks with contrasting backgrounds, while event markers and conditions were recorded.\n\n3. **Movie Watching**: Participants watched four short movies with different themes, with event markers recording the start and stop times of presentations.\n\n#### Active Tasks\n4. **Contrast Change Detection**: Participants identified flickering disks with dominant contrast changes and received feedback based on their responses.\n\n5. **Sequence Learning**: Participants memorized and repeated sequences of flashed circles on the screen, designed for different age groups.\n\n6. **Symbol Search**: Participants performed a computerized symbol search task, identifying target symbols from rows of search symbols.\n\n### Contents\n* **EEG Data:** High-resolution EEG recordings capture a wide range of neural activity during various tasks.\n* **Behavioral Responses:** Participant responses during EEG tasks, including reaction times and accuracy. This data was originally recorded within the behavior directory of the HBN data. The data is now included with the EEG data within the `events.tsv` files.\n\n### Special Features\n* **Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED):** Events, including the original EEG events and the included behavioral events, have clear explanations, including proper HED annotation suitable for systematic meta and mega analysis of the data.\n* **P-Factor, Attention, Internalization and Externalization:** Derived from the CBCL questionnaire, these factors provide valuable insights into the psychopathology of the participants, adding a rich layer of interpretation to the EEG and behavioral data.\n* **Data quality and availability:** We performed minimal quality control to ensure that the data was not corrupted, each task had its necessary events, and was ready for preprocessing. The results of this quality control are available in the `participants.tsv` file.\n* **Future Releases:** We are committed to enhancing this dataset with additional, valuable features in its next stages, including:\n  * **Personalized EEG Electrode Locations:** To offer more detailed insights into individual neural activity patterns.\n  * **Personalized Lead Field Matrix:** Enabling better understanding and interpretation of EEG data.\n  * **Eye-Tracking Data:** Providing a window into the visual attention and processing mechanisms during EEG experiments.\n\n## Other HBN-EEG Datasets\nFor access all releases of the HBN-EEG dataset, follow this [link on NEMAR.org](https://nemar.org/dataexplorer/local?search=HBN-EEG).

Press to begin. First, we have to measure the position of your eyes. Just follow the circle with your eyes.\n\nTask 'RestingState':\nTaskName: RestingState\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed a standard fixation cross in the center of the computer screen. The recorded voice of a female research assistant instructed them to 'now open your eyes' (rest with eyes open for 20 s) and 'now close your eyes' (rest with eyes closed for 40 s); this procedure was repeated 5 times, alternating between eyes opened and eyes closed. For purposes of analysis, we were mainly interested in the eyes-closed condition, due to the lower frequency of eye blinks. However, we interspersed the brief eyes-open blocks throughout the task in order to ensure that participants remained engaged for the duration of the task session.\nInstructions: Fixate on the central cross. Open or close your eyes when you hear the request for it. Press to begin.\n\nTask 'ThePresent':\nTaskName: ThePresent\nTaskDescription: Participants viewed 4 short, age-appropriate video clips taken from television and movies.
